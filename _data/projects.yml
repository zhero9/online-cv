    title: Approximating Nash Social Welfare under Rado Valuations
    authors: Jugal Garg, Edin Husić and László A. Végh.
    arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14793
    abstract: We present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the symmetric Nash social welfare problem under Rado valuations. Rado valuations form a general class of valuation functions that arise from maximum cost independent matching problems, including as special cases assignment (OXS) valuations and weighted matroid rank functions. Our approach also gives the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the asymmetric case under Rado valuations, provided that the maximum ratio between the weights is bounded by a constant.

    title: FPT Algorithms for Finding Dense Subgraphs in c-Closed Graphs
    authors: Edin Husić and Tim Roughgarden.
    arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09768
    abstract: Dense subgraph detection is a fundamental problem in network analysis for which few worst-case guarantees are known, motivating its study through the lens of fixed-parameter tractability. But for what parameter? Recent work has proposed parameterizing graphs by their degree of triadic closure, with a c-closed graph defined as one in which every vertex pair with at least c common neighbors are themselves connected by an edge. The special case of enumerating all maximal cliques (and hence computing a maximum clique) of a c-closed graph is known to be fixed-parameter tractable with respect to c (Fox et al., SICOMP 2020).In network analysis, sufficiently dense subgraphs are typically as notable and meaningful as cliques. We investigate the fixed-parameter tractability (with respect to c) of optimization and enumeration in c-closed graphs, for several notions of dense subgraphs. We focus on graph families that are the complements of the most well-studied notions of sparse graphs, including graphs with bounded degree, bounded treewidth, or bounded degeneracy, and provide fixed-parameter tractable enumeration and optimization algorithms for these families. To go beyond the special case of maximal cliques, we use a new combinatorial bound (generalizing the Moon-Moser theorem); new techniques for exploiting the c-closed condition; and more sophisticated enumeration algorithms.

    title: Auction Algorithms for Market Equilibrium with Weak Gross Substitute Demands
    authors: Jugal Garg, Edin Husić and László A. Végh.
    arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07948
    abstract: We present a simple auction algorithm that obtains an approximate market equilibrium for the exchange market model with divisible goods where the demands of the agents satisfy the weak gross substitutes (WGS) property. As an application of our result, we obtain an efficient algorithm to find an approximate spending-restricted market equilibrium for WGS demands, a model that has been recently introduced as a continuous relaxation of the Nash Social Welfare problem.
